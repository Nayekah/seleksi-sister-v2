   ```bash
   In every other universe
   Nayaka falls for Sister
   And in every other universe... It doesn't end well


   "Well, it's a first time for everything, right?"

   ```

## Footnote
   ```bash
    I know we′re under pressure
    You're so precious, where you came from?
    I can′t still understand this
    I can't get much better than this

    Tryna stay all the night, by your side
    You throwin' my line
    Minutes till the hours done, so i take my time
    And take me through the night

    Cause darling, without you, stars will never shine
    I got these feelings but you never mind
    I wanna tell you that you′re loved, it′s just us in this world
    Tonight, i don't wanna let go

    No no

    You tell me "Just you, i don′t want no one but you"
    Never was a me without a piece of you
    I promise i'll spend all my time with you oh my darlin′

    If you really wanna go, i'll be on your backseat
    If you really wanna know, this love ain′t no toxic
    Tell me if you wanna stay in this garden i've created
    You and i, forever

    If you really wanna go, i'll be on your backseat
    If you really wanna know, this love ain′t no toxic
    Tell me if you wanna stay in this garden i′ve created
    You and i, forever

    I guess we're down for each other, you and i against the world
    Will you be my grace?
    Take me outta space
    Erase all my pains
    This spell will never breaks

    And yes, i wanna stay in the garden you′ve created
    You'd be the stars and i′m the shine
    I'd be the sun and you′re the light
    Make me feel alive

    It's insane how your love can heal my scars
    Now, pass me your heart and i'll take care of it
    Hold me in the dark, hold me in the light
    Thru our best and worst
    I promise that i will stay

    If you really wanna go, i′ll be on your backseat
    If you really wanna know, this love ain′t no toxic
    Tell me if you wanna stay in this garden i've created
    You and i, forever

    If you really wanna go, i′ll be on your backseat
    If you really wanna know, this love ain't no toxic
    Tell me if you wanna stay in this garden i′ve created
    You and i, forever

    If you really wanna go, i'll be on your backseat
    If you really wanna know, this love ain′t no toxic
    Tell me if you wanna stay in this garden i've created
    You and i

   ```
